This example is aimed to create a full-stack todo app with a built-in polkadot-based blockchain as a database. Such database can be easily customizable, contain logic written also in Rust, has strong consistency guarantees, easily replicable and optionally publicly verifiable. These features can be interesting for mission-critical data including finances etc. As of now even code copypasted from polkadot-sdk repo produces compilations errors and the amount of required apis for a minimal example is relatively huge so I've set it aside until things improve.
